## objectives

### 1st version
Trying to create an supervised learning model that takes using `DALI_Data-Anon.json` that takes in two values, creates a regressive model, and then allows the user to input a value to get the expected value. 

## plan

### 1st version
- Will probably use Python because its easy.
- Need to figure out which regressive models are realistically possible for me to accomplish in scikit in a reasonable time

- curr estimated time of completion...: 48 hours??
