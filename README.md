# dalidata

# objectives
Try to create an application that allows users to input their desired attributes(i.e. the independent variables) and their desired label (i.e. the dependant variable that is based on the attributes) and predict a label value based on any attribute. 

Based on how many attributes there are, a variety regression strategies will be used and the model with the least root mean square error will be presented to the user. 

If there is only one attribute specified, simple linear and polynomial regression will be used and the more accurate result of the two will be presented to the user.
